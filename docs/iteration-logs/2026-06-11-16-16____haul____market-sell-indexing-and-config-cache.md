# Iteration Log

- Area: `haul`
- Title: `market-sell-indexing-and-config-cache`
- Started: `2026-06-11 16:16`

## Summary

- Fixed hidden-cargo sell-list indexing for market sales and removed repeated default-message reload overhead from Control Room routine launches.

## Changes

- Rebuilt the market sell list from the demand-sorted `Market.json` view plus the hidden-cargo subset from `Cargo.json` so hidden rows keep their correct cursor positions.
- Threaded `app._time_fn` through the Control Room routine launchers and cached default YAML message loads, cutting local full-suite runtime from `0.687s` to about `0.245s`.
- Added market-indexing and launcher/runtime regression coverage in `tests/test_routines.py`.

## Follow-ups

- Recheck the real market sell flow with multiple hidden cargo rows to confirm the corrected cursor math still matches the live station UI.
